## How to Run the Project Locally

### Starting the Backend Server

To start the backend server, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory where your `package.json` file is located.
3. Run the following command to start the server using `nodemon`:

    ```sh
    npm run server
    ```

    This command will execute the `server` script defined in your `package.json` file.

4. `nodemon` will start and monitor your files for any changes. If any changes are detected, it will automatically restart the server.
5. The server will start and listen on port `8080`. You should see the message:

    ```
    Server is running on the port : 8080
    ```

6. To manually restart the server at any time, enter `rs` in the terminal.

### Starting the Frontend Server

To start the frontend server, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the frontend project directory where your `package.json` file is located.
3. Run the following command to start the development server:

    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```

    This command will execute the `dev` script defined in your `package.json` file.

4. The development server will start and you should see output similar to:

    ```
    VITE v4.5.5  ready in 174 ms

    ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
    ➜  Network: use --host to expose
    ➜  press h to show help
    ```

5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` to view the frontend application.

6. To stop the development server, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.
